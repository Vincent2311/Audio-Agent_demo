We attach examples for further evaluation. The index.html file can be opened by Googol Chrome and render a static website for direct comparison.

All the files in assets/TTA are labeled from 1 to 17 with the same order. The captions for TTA can be found in assets/TTA/caption.csv. 

We additional provide long audio examples for Figure 5 in assets/TTA_long with captions showing in assets/TTA_long/caption_20s.csv.

Files in assets/VTA/AVSync are labeled from 1 to 6 with the same order. The inference audio result has been combined with the video input(muted) for clearer evaluation.

Additional dubbing examples can be found in assets/VTA/anime_dubbing and assets/VTA/silent_movie_dubbing. The procedure for generation can be found in assets/VTA/dubbing_examples.md.

Prompt examples and other comparisons can be found Audio_Agent_supp.pdf.

**Please try to generate the static website from index.html for more ease of evaluation, if possible**
